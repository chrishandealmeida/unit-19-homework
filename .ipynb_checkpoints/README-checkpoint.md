# Unit 19 - Multi-Blockchain Wallet in Python

------------------

### **Description:**

Use the imbalanced learn library to resample the LendingClub data and build and evaluate logistic regression classifiers using the resampled data.

### **Test Transactions:**

### **BTC Transaction**

### **ETH Transaction**
Unfortunately, there were several issues that I encountered when trying to attempt the ETH Transactions.  There were issues with prefunding the ETH account as well as issues with MyCrypto connections.  I attended office hours to receive help with these issues, but neither the TA nor other students were able to solve it either.  Therefore this part of the assignment was not completable.
